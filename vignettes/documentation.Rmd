# timecoursedata: Time course gene expression datasets

## Overview

This package provides time course gene expression datasets. The data included
in the package and its processing is described below. 

Overviw of the datasets included in timecoursedata:

object | description
------- | ------------
`shoemaker2015` | microarray data from influenza-exposed mice


## Data structure

Each datasets in this package are represented by:

- a matrix containing the gene expression data
- a data.frame containing the metadata associated with it

The metadata contains the following information:

column | description
----- | ----------
`row.names` | name of the sample
`Timepoint` | which timepoints this sample belongs to
`Group` | which group this sample belongs to
`Replicate` (optional) | which replicate this sample belongs to
